# Geoset

Geoset allows you to pan and zoom an orthographic projection to calculate the scale and rotation projection settings for a specific area on the globe. This is useful when you aren't sure where exactly your map extent should be and removes the need for trial and error with your projection information.

The interactive drag and zoom map is from Jason Davies' [Rotate the World](http://www.jasondavies.com/maps/rotate/) example.
